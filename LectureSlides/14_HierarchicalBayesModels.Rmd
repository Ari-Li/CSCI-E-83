## Introduction     

Many real-world datasets have discrete categories or strata      

- Example, a chemist might measure a reaction rate at several discrete levels of pH and temperature     

- Example, demographic categories and different regions    

- Apply an hierarchical Bayes model for these situations      

## Introduction    

Key points in this lesson:     

1.	Pooled vs. unpooled models    

2.	Defining hierarchical models through hyperpriors and priors    

3.	Evaluation and comparison of Bayesian models      


## Pooled vs. Unpooled Models

Pooled model computes model coefficients that give the best fit to the overall dataset 

- Pooled model has a flat structure   

- Model coefficients are at the same level     

- Pooling maximizes statistical power using all available data to fit a model    

- Pooling limits flexibility if strata have different behavior  


## Pooled vs. Unpooled Models

Unpooled models are the opposite of pooled models         

- For each category a separate and independent model is fit   

- Approach maximizes flexibility   

- Variance of each of the, many, models ise large   

- Unpooled models has a flat structure     


## Overview of Hierarchical Models   

Hierarchical models find the best of both worlds     

- Hierarchical approach is between the extremes of pooled and unpooled models   

- Hierarchical models constructed as a hierarchy of hyperpriors     

- The Hyperpriors represent the prior information on the pooled data    

- Hyperpriors act as priors for each specific case


## Example: Dangers of Radon in Homes    

The unstable isotope Radon-222 is an invisible and order-less gas    

$Rn_{222}$ is the product of a nuclear decay chain of Uranium 238

## Example: Dangers of Radon in Homes   

Depending on rock and soil type, trace amounts of Uranium-238 are present      

- Uranium is [effectively transported by ground water](https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML0931/ML093160829.pdf)     

- Decay products, including $Rn_{222}$, are dispersed in the environment    
    
- Health risk of Radon infiltration into homes is [well-documented](https://www.epa.gov/radon/health-risk-radon)      

- $Rn_{222}$ is the most prevalent cause of lung cancer amount US nonsmokers    

- Outdoors, $Rn_{222}$ does not accumulate in dangerous quantity     

## Example: Dangers of Radon in Homes   

Depending on rock and soil type, trace amounts of Uranium-238 are present     

- In poorly ventilated buildings, Radon gas accumulates to dangerous levels    

- $Rn_{222}$ molecule is heavy, and accumulates in low areas, such as basements   

- Connections to wells or contact with ground water accumulate more dangerous levels of Radon

## Example: Dangers of Radon in Homes   

Randon concentration changes with soil and rock composition and ground water chemistry   

- $Rn_{222}$ risk changes significantly with geographic location     

- Risk varies considerably in space

## Bayesian Modeling of Radon Concentration      

For this example we construct and compare three models:    

1. A pooled model with a single intercept and slope for all counties    

2. An unpooled model with separate intercepts and slopes for each county   

3. An hierarchical model with hyperpriors for all counties    
    - Next level are slopes and intercepts for each county computed using the hyperpriors.
