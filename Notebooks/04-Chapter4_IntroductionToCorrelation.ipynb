    "# Introduction to Correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Correlation**, is a measure of **statistical dependence** between two variables, and an important summary statistic. However, it is hard to over-emphasize the point that **correlation is not causation**!. Variables can be highly correlated for any number of reasons, none of which imply a causal relationship. When trying to understand relationships between variables, it is worth the effort to think carefully and ask the question, does this relationship make sense?    \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many useful measures of statistical dependence. Some of these methods are specific to the application. In this section we will use three measures of correlation. Each of these measures has somewhat different properties.    \n",
    "\n",
    "One of several pitfalls in interpretation of correlation, regardless of method used, is that these measures are all symmetric. This means that even if a causal relationship exists, one cannot tell which variable is the causal one. The correlation measure is the same!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pearson's correlation coefficient\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will use the **Pearson correlation coefficient**, originally published by Karl Pearson [@Pearson_1895].  According to research by Steven Stigler [@Stigler_1989] Frances Galton likely used this method as early as 1877. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Pearson correlation coefficient is the most widely used measure of statistical dependency. When people use the term 'correlation', they often mean Pearson correlation. The Pearson correlation coefficient, between two vectors $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{y}$, can be writen:   \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\rho_{\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{\\mathbf{x}})(y_i - \\bar{\\mathbf{y}})}{\\sigma_{\\mathbf{x}} \\sigma_{\\mathbf{y}}}\n",
    "$$   \n",
    "\n",
    "Where;    \n",
    "$\\bar{\\mathbf{x}} =$ the mean of the vector $\\mathbf{x}$,   \n",
    "$\\bar{\\mathbf{y}} =$ the mean of the vector $\\mathbf{y}$,  \n",
    "$\\sigma_{\\mathbf{x}} =$ the variance of the vector $\\mathbf{x}$,   \n",
    "$\\sigma_{\\mathbf{y}} =$ the variance of the vector $\\mathbf{y}$.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the Pearson correlation is normalized by the product of the variances of the two vectors. This means that the value must be in the range, $-1 \\ge \\rho_{\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}} \\ge 1$. To understand the behavior of this statistic, it helps to keep some particular values in mind:     \n",
    "- $\\rho_{\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}} = 1$, the vectors are perfectly correlated, meaning the relative change in one exactly corresponds to the same relative change in the other. In other words, the vectors are parallel.        \n",
    "- $\\rho_{\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}} = 0$, the vectors are uncorrelated, meaning there is no relationship between the two vectors. In other words, the vectors are **orthogonal**.    \n",
    "- $\\rho_{\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}} = -1$, the vectors are perfectly anti-correlated, meaning a relative change in one exactly corresponds to the same relative change in the other with the opposite sign.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Another important property of Pearson correlation is that it is linear in the value pairs $(x_i,y_i)$. This property has several implications. For example, as the value of one variable changes the other will change by a proportion of the correlation coefficient. Further, the value of the correlation coefficient can be significantly affected by outliers in the values of the variables.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will have more to say about the statistical properties of Pearson correlation in Part 3 of this book.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### An example\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use an example to illustrate the pitfalls of interpreting correlation. @Messerli reported a high correlation between chocolate consumption per person in a country and the number of people per ten million in that country who win Nobel Prizes. Messerli states that there may be some improvement in cognitive function from compounds known as flavonoids contained in chocolate. \n",
    "\n",
    "Messerli's work was widely discussed in the popular press. Many people would like to think that eating more chocolate increases their chances of winning a Nobel Prize. But, does this relationship really make sense for an entire population of a country? This conclusion has been challenged by a number of other authors, including @Maurage_etal.    \n",
